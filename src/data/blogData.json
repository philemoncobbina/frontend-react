Christians, the narrator says, cannot be egalitarians — those who believe all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.

Feminism tries to make women think they are victims of an oppressive, male-dominated, patriarchal society.” Further, she asserts the feminist movement set out to make the role of fulltime wife and homemaker economically impossible and socially disdained."
